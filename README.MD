# Style-Transfer

Based on "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", with tensorflow.

## Notice

* The style image and the content image are fixed in the code, if you want to change them you can do it in the source code.
* Using tensorflow gpu version will be much more efficiently.
* The style image should be in some abstract style. Using ordinary image will make the result picture come to a blur one.
* You need pretrained VGG19 model. That is `imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat`

## Improvement

* You can use color transfer before style transfer.
* I'm working on how to change a photo into the anime style. It is not finished now.
